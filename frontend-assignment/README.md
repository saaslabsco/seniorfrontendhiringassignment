# Frontend Assignment - SaaS Labs

👋 **Welcome to the SaaS Labs Frontend Assignment!**

This project is part of the **SaaS Labs Frontend Assignment**, where the goal was to build a **Kickstarter Campaign Summary** dashboard with the following features:

- Display a table of projects.
- Handle pagination for large datasets.
- Show a loading state and error state based on data fetching.
- Implement a responsive design for optimal viewing on mobile and desktop.
- Improve the UI for a more appealing user experience.

## 📍 Features

- **Table Display**: Displays project data with columns such as "S.No.", "Percentage Funded", and "Amount Pledged".
- **Pagination**: Handles large datasets by displaying projects in pages with easy navigation through "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is mobile-friendly and works seamlessly across devices.
- **Error Handling**: The app gracefully handles loading and error states when fetching data.
- **Styling**: The app uses clean and modern styles, with some hover effects and button transitions.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety in development.
